Project 1

This project was technically challenging for me because I have never preciously
used go lang, and starting with network libraries was also a little difficult
when I didn't even know how to declare variables. This was a simple project so
I wanted to take the opportunity to learn something new.

Error handling was also a challenge since Go does not natively throw errors. You
can return errors from functions, but you have to handle them on your own and
stop execution.

The approach I took was to go through the following steps
* Parse flags first
* Parse arguments next, and ignore any flags that were described in the problem
* If SSL is true then make sure to create correct config for go connection
* Loop until server sends a solution back, the solution is anything that is
  returned and is only 2 strings

I also handle errors with handleError(). Since go doesn't throw errors, I had
to check for errors after each function.
